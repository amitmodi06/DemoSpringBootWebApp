Demo Spring Boot Aplication

This is a demo web application using Spring Boot, in which I used the followoing:
- Spring MVC
- Thymeleaf
- JPA
- Spring Data Repositories
- Used CommandLineRunner to initialize with the sample data
- Used H2 Database



I've done the resource mapping with the following urls:
- /books
- /authors

After running the application, type in the browser:
- localhost:8081/books   :- To have a look at the table with all the books
- localhost:8081/authors :- To hava a look at the table with all the authors
